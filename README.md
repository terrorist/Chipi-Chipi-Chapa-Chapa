# Chipi-Chipi-Chapa-Chapa
please help me, being held hostage.


# Tutorial
place your vlc installation on your usb aswell as your_video.mp4.

in my case i used the video of the chipi chipi chapa chapa cat

run main.py and insert your usb into your pc = profit :3


# Headless / Hidden CMD
rename main.py to main.pyw

right click on main.pyw and create shortcut

right click on the shortcus and choose properties

in the shortcut tab find target

change target to include pythonw.exe and the path to main.pyw

example: C:\Path\to\pythonw.exe C:\Path\to\main.pyw

now run the main.pyw through the shortcut instead of doing "python main.pyw" in console.

that way no cmd is shown and script runs in background and waits for a usb to be inserted
